My name is Chao Wen. I'm a PhD student at the [Max Planck Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS)](https://www.mpi-sws.org/). I am advised by [Dr. Adish Singla](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/adishsingla.html) in the [Machine Teaching](https://machineteaching.mpi-sws.org/) Group.

My research interests include generative AI for programming education, program synthesis, and large language models.


In my free time, I enjoy a variety of sports and outdoor activities. I'm particularly fond of swimming, football, hiking, and table tennis. When I'm not in the lab, you might find me exploring hiking trails around Saarbrücken:)
